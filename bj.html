    <p class="detailsp">Beetlejuice is a 1988 American fantasy horror comedy film directed by Tim Burton, written by
        Michael
        McDowell and Warren Skaaren, produced by The Geffen Company, distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, and starring
        Alec Baldwin, Geena Davis, Jeffrey Jones, Catherine O'Hara, Winona Ryder, and Michael Keaton as the titular
        character. The plot revolves around a recently deceased couple who, as ghosts haunting their former home,
        contact Betelgeuse (pronounced and occasionally spelled Beetlejuice in the film), an obnoxious and devious
        "bio-exorcist" from the Netherworld, to scare away the house's new inhabitants.

        Beetlejuice was a critical and commercial success, grossing US$74.2 million from a budget of US$15 million. It
        won the Academy Award for Best Makeup and three Saturn Awards: Best Horror Film, Best Makeup, and Best
        Supporting Actress for Sylvia Sidney. The film's success spawned an animated television series, video games, and
        a 2018 stage musical.

    <h3 class="plot">Plot</h3>
    <p class="detailsp">In Winter River, Connecticut, Barbara and Adam Maitland decide to spend their vacation
        decorating their idyllic country home. As they are driving home from a trip to town, Barbara swerves to avoid a
        dog and the car plunges into the river. All of a sudden, they return home with no memory of how they got there;
        discovering they now lack reflections, can't feel pain, and when Adam attempts to leave the house, he ends up in
        a strange and otherworldly desert-like landscape populated by enormous sandworms. They also find a book called
        the Handbook for the Recently Deceased in their living room, causing them to realize they did not survive the
        car crash.

        The house is sold and the new owners, the Deetz family, arrive from New York City. Charles Deetz a level-headed
        real estate developer; his second wife Delia a shallow sculptor with bad taste; and his teenage goth daughter
        Lydia, from his first marriage, an aspiring photographer. Under the guidance of interior designer Otho, the
        family transforms the house into a pastel-toned work of modern art.

        Consulting the Handbook, the Maitlands travel to an otherworldly waiting room populated by other distressed
        souls where they discover the afterlife is structured according to a complex bureaucracy involving vouchers and
        caseworkers. The Maitlands' caseworker Juno informs them they must remain in the house for the next one hundred
        and twenty five years on pain of a dire fate. If they want the Deetzes out of the house, it is up to them to
        scare them away.

        Although Adam and Barbara remain invisible to Charles and Delia, Lydia can see the ghost couple and befriends
        them. Against Juno's advice, the Maitlands contact the miscreant Betelgeuse, Juno's former assistant and a now
        freelance "bio-exorcist", to scare away the Deetzes. At first, they are unaware his name is pronounced
        "Beetlejuice", which is why they have such difficulty pronouncing it and thereby summoning him.

        However, Betelgeuse quickly offends the Maitlands with his crude and morbid demeanor: they reconsider hiring
        him, though too late to stop him from wreaking havoc on the Deetzes. The small town's charm and the supernatural
        events inspire Charles to pitch his boss Maxie Dean on transforming the town into a tourist hot spot, but Maxie
        wants proof of the ghosts. Using the Handbook for the Recently Deceased, Otho conducts what he thinks is a
        s√©ance and summons Adam and Barbara, using their wedding clothes, but they begin to age and decay as Otho had
        unwittingly performed an exorcism instead.

        Horrified, Lydia summons Betelgeuse for help; but he will only help her on the condition that she marries him,
        enabling him to freely cause chaos in the mortal world. He saves the Maitlands and disposes of Maxie, his wife,
        and Otho, then prepares a wedding before a ghastly minister. The Maitlands intervene before the ceremony is
        completed, with Barbara riding a sandworm through the house to devour Betelgeuse.

        Finally, the Deetzes and Maitlands agree to live in harmony within the house. Betelgeuse is stuck in the
        after-life waiting room. He switches number tickets with a witch doctor who shrinks his head. Being Betelgeuse
        however, he remains upbeat and states that it is a good look for him. Lydia dances happily away with the ghosts.
