    <p class="detailsp">Carrie is a 2013 American supernatural horror film directed by Kimberly Peirce. It is the third
        film adaptation and a remake to the 1976 adaptation of Stephen King's 1974 novel of the same name and the fourth
        film in the Carrie franchise. The film was produced by Kevin Misher, with a screenplay by Lawrence D. Cohen and
        Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa. The film stars Chloë Grace Moretz as the titular character Carrie White, alongside
        Julianne Moore as Margaret White. The cast also features Judy Greer, Portia Doubleday, Gabriella Wilde, Ansel
        Elgort and Alex Russell. The film is a modern re-imagining of King's novel about a shy girl outcast by her peers
        and sheltered by her deeply religious mother, who uses her telekinetic powers with devastating effect after
        falling victim to a cruel prank at her senior prom.

        The film held its world premiere at the Arclight Hollywood in Los Angeles on October 7, 2013, and was released
        in the United States by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Screen Gems on October 18, 2013. The film received mixed
        reviews, with critics calling it "unnecessary" and criticizing the lack of originality and scares, though they
        praised the modern updates and cast.[3] It grossed $84 million worldwide at the box office.

    <h3 class="plot">Plot</h3>
    <p class="detailsp">Disturbed religious fanatic Margaret White sits alone in her home on her bed and gives birth to
        a baby girl. She intends to kill the infant but changes her mind.

        Years later, her daughter Carrie, a shy, unassertive girl, nears her graduation from Ewen High School in Maine.
        While showering after the gym at school, Carrie experiences her first menstrual period. Never having been taught
        to prepare for this, she believes she is bleeding to death and runs out of the shower yelling for help. The
        other girls ridicule her by throwing tampons and pads at her. Longtime bully Christine "Chris" Hargensen records
        everything on her smartphone and uploads it to YouTube. The school's physical education teacher Miss Rita
        Desjardin, comforts Carrie and sends her home with Margaret, who believes menstruation is a sin. Margaret
        demands that Carrie abstain from showering with the others. When Carrie refuses, Margaret hits her in the
        forehead with a Bible and locks her in her "prayer closet." As Carrie screams to be let out, a crack appears on
        the door, and the crucifix in the closet begins to bleed. Carrie begins to experience more signs over the
        oncoming days that point to her having telekinesis. She researches her abilities, learning to harness them.

        Miss Desjardin threatens the girls who teased Carrie with an ultimatum: either endure boot-camp-style detention
        for their behavior or be suspended from school, prohibiting them from attending prom; Chris is the only one who
        refuses to take part in detention and is suspended from school after denying the allegation and refusing to give
        up her smartphone. Sue Snell regrets her part in the incident. To make amends, she asks her boyfriend, Tommy
        Ross, to take Carrie to the prom. Carrie accepts Tommy's invitation and makes a prom dress at home. Her mother,
        Margaret, forbids Carrie to attend. Asking her mother to relent, Carrie manifests her telekinesis. Margaret
        believes this power comes from the Devil and is proof that Carrie has been corrupted by sin. Meanwhile, Chris,
        her boyfriend Billy Nolan, and his friends plan revenge on Carrie; they obtain pig blood to put in a bucket.

        On Prom Night, Margaret tries to prevent Carrie from going, but Carrie uses her powers to lock her mother in the
        closet. At the prom, Carrie is nervous and shy, but Tommy kindly puts her at ease. As part of Chris and Billy's
        plan, Chris's friend, Tina Blake, discreetly slips fake ballots into the voting box, which names Carrie and
        Tommy as prom queen and king. At home, Sue receives a text from Chris, taunting her about her scheme to
        humiliate Carrie. Sue drives to the prom, arriving just as Carrie and Tommy are about to be crowned. Billy warns
        Chris not to tell anyone about the bucket as it is criminal assault; Chris agrees to say nothing. Sue sees the
        bucket of blood dangling above Carrie and attempts to warn someone. Desjardin locks her out of the gym,
        suspecting that Sue plans to hurt Carrie.

        Chris dumps the blood onto Carrie and Tommy. Nicki plays the "shower video" of Carrie on the large screens above
        the stage, inciting laughter from some in the audience. Carrie pushes Miss Desjardin with her powers when
        Desjardin attempts to help her. The bucket falls onto Tommy's head, killing him. Enraged, Carrie takes her
        revenge and uses her telekinesis to kill nearly every student and staff, but spares Desjardin. An electrical
        wire merges with leaking water, and a fire breaks out. As the school burns to the ground, Carrie walks away,
        leaving behind a trail of destruction. Chris and Billy attempt to drive away, but Carrie crashes the car,
        killing Billy. Chris attempts to run Carrie over, but Carrie lifts the car and throws it at a gas station,
        killing her. Carrie tips over an electric power pole, setting the car on fire.

        Carrie arrives home and takes a bath and changes into her nightgown afterward. Carrie tearfully tells Margaret
        about the prank. Carrie and Margaret embrace and Margaret recounts Carrie's conception. After having shared a
        bed platonically with her husband, they yielded to temptation one night, and, after praying for strength,
        Carrie's father "took" Margaret, who enjoyed the experience. After the talk, Margaret stabs Carrie in the back
        with a knife. She declares that she must kill Carrie in order to prevent the Devil from possessing her again and
        attacks Carrie, but Carrie kills her with several sharp tools. She becomes hysterical and makes stones rain from
        the sky to crush the house. When Sue arrives, a furious Carrie lifts her with her powers but senses that Sue is
        pregnant with a baby girl. Carrie protects Sue and throws her out of the house to safety as the house collapses
        and sinks, apparently killing Carrie as well.

        After giving her testimony in court regarding the prom incident, Sue visits Carrie and Margaret's grave, which
        has been vandalized to read "CARRIE WHITE BURNS IN HELL," and places white roses by the headstone. As she
        leaves, the gravestone begins to break, and Carrie's enraged scream is heard.
