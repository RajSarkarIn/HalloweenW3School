    <p class="detailsp">Halloween Ends is a 2022 American slasher film that is the sequel to Halloween Kills (2021), the
        thirteenth installment in the Halloween franchise, and the final film in the trilogy of sequels that started
        with the 2018 film, which directly follows the 1978 film. Directed by David Gordon Green and co-written by
        Green, Danny McBride, Paul Brad Logan and Chris Bernier, the film stars Jamie Lee Curtis, Andi Matichak, Rohan
        Campbell, Will Patton, Kyle Richards, and James Jude Courtney. The film revolves around Corey Cunningham, a
        young man who falls in love with Laurie Strode's granddaughter while a series of events, including crossing
        paths with Michael Myers, upend his life and render him a murderous outcast.

        Before the release of Halloween in 2018, McBride confirmed that he and Green had intended to pitch two films
        that would be shot back-to-back, but decided against it, waiting to see the reaction to the first film.
        Following the success of the first film, in July 2019, the film's title was announced along with Halloween
        Kills. Green intended to give each film in the trilogy its own unique theme, Halloween Ends being a "love
        story"; John Carpenter described the film as a "departure" from its predecessors. After being delayed due to the
        ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, principal photography took place in Georgia between January and March 2022, with
        re-shoots taking place in mid-2022.

    <h3 class="plot">Plot</h3>
    <p class="detailsp">On Halloween night in 2019, 21-year-old Corey Cunningham babysits a young boy named Jeremy, who
        pulls a prank on Corey by locking him inside the attic. Just as Jeremy's parents come home, Corey kicks the door
        open and accidentally knocks Jeremy over a staircase railing to his death. Corey is accused of intentionally
        killing Jeremy but is cleared of manslaughter.

        Three years later, the town of Haddonfield, Illinois, is still reeling from the aftermath of Michael Myers's
        latest killing spree in 2018,[a] while Michael has vanished. Laurie Strode is writing a memoir, having bought a
        new house and living with Allyson, her granddaughter, who is now a nurse. Meanwhile, Corey is working at his
        stepfather's salvage yard. On his way home one day, he is taunted by high school bullies and injures himself in
        the process. An observing Laurie brings him to the doctor's office where Allyson works after slashing the
        bullies' tires. Allyson and Corey develop a relationship and later attend a Halloween party, where Corey is
        confronted by Jeremy's mother. After having an argument with Allyson, Corey leaves the party and runs into the
        bullies, who throw him off a bridge. He is dragged into the sewers and confronted by Michael, who eventually
        lets him go. On the way out, Corey is confronted by a homeless man. In a struggle, Corey stabs the man to death
        and flees.

        Corey and Allyson go on a dinner date, but Allyson's ex-boyfriend, police officer Doug Mulaney, shows up and
        harasses them both. Corey later lures the cop into the sewer. Michael emerges and kills Doug to Corey's delight.
        Allyson is passed over for a promotion at work, in favor of a fellow nurse who is having an affair with the
        doctor. Corey then kills the doctor at his home while the nurse is killed by Michael. An unknowing Allyson plans
        to leave Haddonfield with an insistent Corey because of the past trauma, while Laurie becomes increasingly
        suspicious of Corey. After finding him sleeping in the spot where Jeremy died, Laurie offers to help him on the
        condition that he distances himself from Allyson. Corey retorts by blaming her for the events that have occurred
        in Haddonfield and says if he cannot have Allyson, no one will.

        On October 31, Corey returns to the sewers and successfully fights Michael for his mask. Meanwhile, Laurie and
        Allyson argue as she plans to leave, and Allyson, too, blames Laurie for Michael's actions. That night, Corey
        embarks on a rampage, murdering the bullies after luring them to the salvage yard, one of whom accidentally
        kills his stepfather. He then goes on to kill his mother, as well as a DJ at a local radio station, who had
        taunted him earlier.

        At the Strode house, Laurie faux-attempts suicide to lure Corey to her, whom she shoots down the stairs. Corey
        then stabs himself in the neck to frame Laurie for his death in front of the arriving Allyson. Michael suddenly
        arrives and kills Corey. A fight ensues, and Laurie manages to pin Michael to the table. After a struggle,
        Allyson arrives to help subdue and finally kill him. Laurie and Allyson take his body to the salvage yard by
        police escort, attracting the residents of Haddonfield, who follow them in a procession, and dispose of it in an
        industrial shredder. In the ensuing days, Allyson and Laurie reconcile, and Allyson leaves Haddonfield while
        Laurie finishes her memoir and rediscovers her romance with Deputy Hawkins.
