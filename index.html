        <h1 class="ba" id="history">About Halloween</h1>
    </center>
    <p class="p1">Halloweens origins can be traced back to the ancient Celtic festival known as Samhain, which was held
        on November 1 in contemporary calendars. It was believed that on that day, the souls of the dead returned to
        their homes, so people dressed in costumes and lit bonfires to ward off spirits. In this way, popular Halloween
        tropes such as witches, ghosts, and goblins became associated with the holiday.</p>
    <h2 class="his">History:-</h2>
    <p class="p2">In the 7th century CE, Pope Boniface IV created All Saints Day, originally celebrated on May 13. A
        century later, Pope Gregory III moved the holiday to November 1, likely as a Christian substitute for the pagan
        festival of Samhain. The day before the saintly celebration became known as All Hallows Eve, or Halloween.
        Though the holiday began in Celtic regions of Ireland, the United Kingdom, and France, it quickly spread to
        other parts of the world. The first American colonists in New England were forbidden to celebrate it for
        religious reasons, though it enjoyed some popularity in the Southern colonies. By the 1800s, fall festivals
        marking the seasonal harvest incorporated Halloween elements, and Irish immigrants escaping the devastating
        Potato Famine brought with them many Halloween traditions that remain today.</p>

    <p class="p3">Trick-or-treating is a Halloween tradition in which participants, often children, go door to door to
        collect treats from homeowners within their neighborhoods. The "trick" refers to a threat, usually idle, to
        perform mischief on the homeowner(s) or their property if no treat is given, and the "treat" is usually some
        form of candy. </p>
